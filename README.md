# openautoimage
My custom Image with OpenAuto pre-compiled for a raspberry pi 3. This allows you to have a sudo plug and play experience with running android auto on a raspberry pi.

This image uses Raspbian as a base and has f1xpl's android auto head unit emulator software installed on it (https://github.com/f1xpl/openauto). He has the build instructions list on his wiki for building from scratch. The backlight on screen is controlled with rpi-backlight (https://github.com/linusg/rpi-backlight).

On top of those I have added desktop short cuts to launch OpenAuto and to dim and increase the brightness of the official Pi screen
